Hi I'm Freddy. I'm a second-year CS PhD student at Princeton. I'm interested in algorithmic game theory - analyzing algorithms for settings where agents have their own incentives. I am fortunate to be advised by [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/) and to collaborate with [Robert Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/). During my undergrad at Princeton, I'm grateful to have also collaborated with [Sahil Singla](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ssingla7/) and [Huacheng Yu](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~hy2/).
