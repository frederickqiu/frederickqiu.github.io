Hi I'm Freddy. I'm a second-year CS PhD student at Princeton. I'm interested in algorithmic mechanism design - developing algorithms for settings in which users have their own incentives. I am fortunate be advised by [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/) and collaborate with [Robert Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rdk/). During my undergrad at Princeton, I'm grateful to have also worked with [Huacheng Yu](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~hy2/) and [Sahil Singla](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ssingla7/)
